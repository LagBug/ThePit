# ThePit
A remake of the popular ThePit game from Hypixel. This version is quite outdated and not maintained though. ThePit is an FFA (Free For All) PVP game. Its gameplay is pretty easy as your main goal is to fight and kill as many players as you can. Every time you get a kill, you will be rewarded with XP and gold, depending on your level. With gold, you can purchase items, upgrades, and perks which give you an advantage whilst fighting others. XP is used to level up. Gold can be earned in various ways, the simpler one is by killing others but you can also pick it up from the ground or claim bounties that are randomly getting placed if a player has a high streak. With gold, you can also a purchase diamond armor, sword, arrows, and obsidian which will help you advance faster. Perks are helpful as well as they give you a different feeling when playing, where you can have golden heads instead of golden apples, earn 7x more gold from pick-ups and much more! Finally, upgrades will help you more since your blocks will stay longer, you will earn more XP and gold, or you will deal more damage.
